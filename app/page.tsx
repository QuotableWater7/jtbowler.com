          <div>
            I&apos;ve worked at 4 startups over my career because I love
            building new products from the ground up. I care deeply about
            finding the simplest solutions to problems and getting value into
            customer hands quickly. I also love finding ways to boost the
            productivity of the engineering team and scale processes as
            organizations grow.

            I am a lifelong learner and have skills in a wide variety of
            disciplines. I have played lead-guitar in a band, snowboarded down
            steep terrain, attained a top 0.5% chess rating (chess.com) and hit
            top 2-3% in multiple games like Overwatch and Rocket League. If
            I&apos;m not coding, I&apos;m trying to get better at{" "}
